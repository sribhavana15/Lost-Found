My focus was on creating intuitive forms, ensuring accessibility, and validating user input before submission to the backend.

- **Styling and Responsiveness**  
  Customized the UI using `styles.css` to ensure mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

- **Image Assets**  
  Managed UI-related image assets (`img.webp`, `img1.jpeg`) and ensured proper layout integration.

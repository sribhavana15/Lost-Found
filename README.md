## Sri Bhavana Chava – Frontend Developer

As the Frontend Developer for the Lost & Found Web Application, I was responsible for designing and implementing user-friendly, responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My focus was on creating intuitive forms, ensuring accessibility, and validating user input before submission to the backend.

### Key Contributions

- **Form Interfaces**  
  Designed and built the `report-found.html` and `report-lost.html` pages, enabling users to submit detailed item reports.

- **JavaScript Form Logic**  
  Implemented `form-validation.js` to validate user input and enhance error handling on the client side. Developed `foundForm.js` to handle found item submission events and improve user experience.

- **User Registration and UI**  
  Contributed to `register.html` and `index.html`, ensuring clear navigation and consistent Materialize styling.

- **Styling and Responsiveness**  
  Customized the UI using `styles.css` to ensure mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

- **Image Assets**  
  Managed UI-related image assets (`img.webp`, `img1.jpeg`) and ensured proper layout integration.

### Tools & Technologies

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6
- Materialize CSS framework
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub for version control
